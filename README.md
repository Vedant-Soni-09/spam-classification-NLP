# SMS Spam Collection Dataset

## About Dataset

**Context:**
The SMS Spam Collection is a dataset of SMS tagged messages designed for SMS Spam research. It encompasses 5,574 SMS messages in English, categorized as either ham (legitimate) or spam.

**Content:**
The dataset consists of a file with one message per line. Each line has two columns: `v1` contains the label (ham or spam), and `v2` contains the raw text.

**Sources:**
- 425 SMS spam messages manually extracted from the Grumbletext Web site, a UK forum where users share claims about SMS spam.

- A subset of 3,375 randomly chosen ham messages from the NUS SMS Corpus (NSC), a dataset of around 10,000 legitimate messages collected for research at the Department of Computer Science at the National University of Singapore.

## Inspiration

Explore the dataset and leverage its contents to build a prediction model capable of accurately classifying texts as spam or ham. Can you develop a machine learning model to achieve this goal?
